## 🎯 **Core Systems Implemented**

### **Enhanced Health System**
- Player: 5 HP starting → Progressive scaling with levels
- Invulnerability frames (1 sec flashing)
- Health bar UI (supports 4 players)
- Screen shake + visual feedback on damage
- **Progressive health bonuses:** +3 HP per level (scales up every 5 levels)

### **Advanced Multi-Shot Weapon System**

- **Power 2:** Triple shot (center + 2 diagonal)
- **Power 3:** Five shot (wider spread)  
- **Power 5:** Seven shot (full spread)
- **Enhanced damage system:** Base damage + bullet power combined
- **Visual effects:** Power-based bullet colors and trail effects
- Diagonal bullets use trigonometry for proper angles

### **Progressive Player Scaling**
- **Size scaling:** 5% bigger every 2 levels (visual progression)
- **Health scaling:** Progressive bonuses (3→5→7→9 HP per level every 5 levels)
- **Damage scaling:** +1 base damage every 3 levels
- **Ship upgrades:** New ship design every 6 levels (8 different ship types)
- **Stat preservation:** All upgrades carry over during ship changes

### **Power-Up System**
- **5 Types:** Health (+2 HP), Attack Speed (faster fire), Triple/Five/Mega Shot
- **Progressive Rarity:** Higher power levels exponentially rarer
- **Dynamic Weights:** Spawn rates change based on player's current power
- **Visual Effects:** Color tints, floating text, collection flashes
- **Smart Spawning:** Appears in catchable screen positions
- **Proper health icon:** Medical cross symbol for health power-ups

### **Enhanced Enemy System**
- **8 Different Ship Types:** Progressive unlock with levels
- **Varied Attack Patterns:** Single, rapid, burst, spread, heavy, sniper, bomber, elite
- **Ship progression:** New enemy types unlock every 2 levels
- **Stronger scaling:** Much higher health values (2-800 HP range)
- **Faster progression:** Score thresholds at 500, 1k, 1.5k, 2.5k, 4k...
- **Aggressive spawning:** More enemies (8-20 per wave), faster spawn rates

### **Infinite Difficulty Scaling**
- **Score Thresholds:** 500, 1k, 1.5k, 2.5k, 4k, 6.5k, 10k... (accelerated progression)
- **Enemy Health:** 2 → 4 → 7 → 12 → 20 → 32 → 50... (much stronger scaling)
- **Enemy Colors:** White → Yellow → Orange → Red → Magenta → Purple...
- **Player Bonuses:** Progressive health scaling + damage bonuses + size increases
- **Visual Progression:** Level counter, progress tracker, celebration effects

## ⚖️ **Balance Features**

### **Attack Speed Cap**
- Minimum fire rate: 2 frames (prevents machine gun spam)
- Configurable in Player.js `improveFireRate()` method

### **Progressive Power-Up Rarity**
```javascript
Base Rates: Health(35%) > AttackSpeed(30%) > Triple(25%) > Five(8%) > Mega(2%)
Dynamic: Once player has power, lower powers become 70-90% less likely
```

### **Enhanced Enemy Difficulty**

- **More enemies per wave:** 8-20 instead of 5-15
- **Stronger bullets:** Enemy power scales 1-8 based on level
- **Faster movement:** 2x enemy movement speed
- Visual damage numbers and progressive explosion effects
